Cities have terrible traffic congestion, which has negative effects on society, the environment, and the economy. The complexity of managing traffic is rising in tandem with the size and population of cities. due to the difficulty of controlling traffic. Conventional approaches to controlling multifaceted and dynamic traffic congestion, such as building infrastructure and building construction, have inherent limitations. due to the constantly shifting nature of traffic congestion. Predictive analytics and machine learning could be applied to this situation to find a solution. When predictive models incorporate geographic information, historical traffic data, and environmental conditions, they may be able to estimate traffic more accurately. This is a result of these models' improved traffic forecasting. This study assesses the amount of traffic congestion over a 12-hour period in a large US urban area. For this, a large dataset spanning from April 1991 to September 1991 is used.
The spatial and temporal aspects of traffic flow are represented by the congestion measurements for 65 routes in the dataset. Given that the dataset has measurements, this is doable. The goal of this research is to produce trustworthy prediction models for decision-making and traffic control. The goal of the project is to develop trustworthy prediction models. Extensive study on time, location, and direction will be required for these models. The goal of this initiative is to construct urban transit networks that are more ecologically friendly and efficient. Data-driven insights and machine learning will be used to do this.

Statement:
We're talking about efficient urban traffic management right now. An absolute must. Quality of life, environmental sustainability, and transportation networks all suffer as a result. The primary focus of this discussion is efficient management of traffic congestion. Despite the construction of infrastructure and roadways, conventional approaches usually do not take traffic dynamics into account. This is true even for completed tasks. In order to predict twelve hours of traffic congestion in a major US metro region, this study uses machine learning. Refer to southern California for this location. We're hoping that this will enable us to get around these restrictions. To estimate traffic congestion on 65 routes with any degree of accuracy, historical traffic data, topographical data, and environmental parameters are required. This will make it possible to reach the goal. 

Conclusion:
Our study shown that traffic route prediction by machine learning algorithms is dependent on congestion. This is what we came to after extensive research. The Decision Tree and Random Forest models fared well in this context, with 90.9% and 90.06% accuracy rates, respectively, whereas the Support Vector Machine (SVM) performed badly. Both models had high accuracy scores. These findings highlight the importance of choosing the best algorithms for traffic prediction jobs by taking into account variables like dataset complexity and algorithm performance by taking into account the previously mentioned qualities. The potential application of Decision Tree and Random Forest in real-world traffic control systems is indicated by their capacity to estimate traffic pathways. 
Transport authorities can employ machine learning-based techniques and historical traffic data to make well-informed judgments that promote urban mobility and lessen traffic congestion. This is demonstrated by their ability to accurately anticipate traffic routes. In the future, ensemble techniques and sophisticated machine learning algorithms might be researched. This project aims to increase system scalability and forecast accuracy. It's an understatement to say that this is a fantastic start. The timeliness and accuracy of traffic route predictions may be improved by real-time data sources like GPS tracking and traffic cameras. Overall, our research advances our understanding of machine learning's capacity to predict traffic patterns. This plan could address current issues with urban transportation administration.
